			<h2>Question:- What is even Loop?</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Answer:</b>An event loop is a programming construct that allows a program to handle multiple events or tasks simultaneously. It works by having the program keep track of all the events or
				tasks that need to be processed, and then processing them one by one as they come in. This can be a very efficient way to handle a lot of events or tasks, as it prevents the program from
				getting bogged down by having to process everything at once.
